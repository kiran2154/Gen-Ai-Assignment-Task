#Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models.
The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

## Tasks Covered

* Task 1: NLP Preprocessing Pipeline
* Task 2: Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

#  Dataset for task 2

The dataset used is the IMDB Dataset of  Movie Reviews**.

#Project Pipeline

Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Comparison

# NLP Preprocessing Steps

* Lowercasing text
* Removing punctuation
* Removing stopwords
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Removing HTML tags and URLs
  
# Feature Engineering

* Bag of Words (BoW)
* TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

# Models Implemented

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree

#Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
  
#Results & Insights

* Logistic Regression performed the best among all models
* TF-IDF gave better results compared to Bag of Words
* Achieved approximately **~90% accuracy**

#Model Comparison

| Model               | Performance | Notes                            |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Logistic Regression |  Best      | High accuracy and stable         |
| Naive Bayes         | Good        | Fast but slightly lower accuracy |
| Decision Tree       | Average     | Tends to overfit                 |
